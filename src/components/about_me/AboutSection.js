                        I start coding in the school and create projects with Turbo Pascal, and visual studio. I discover Flash, Html, Css and Dreaweaver to make simple websites.

                        I think making such a big change in my life allowed me to face most of my fears and reassured my self-confidence and trust in my capabilities, which is difficult for someone that is constantly pushing himself to be better.

                        That last experience is what brings me to this moment, returning to my humble beginnings in web development. With all the work experience I gathered on different companies, and the practice gained by studying engineering and a masters, I‚Äôm now focusing all my energy and knowledge into becoming the best web developer I can be, hoping to work in this industry for the rest of my professional life.

                        I know I might be late in the game, but I‚Äôm studying new technologies every day, coding and building projects as often as I can, and looking forward to gaining work experience in web development related companies.

                        I‚Äôm a firm believer in the growth mindset concept, and that ‚Äúlife is not about finding yourself, but about creating yourself‚Äù (George Bernard Shaw).
