                        My interest in technology started when I was a teenager and <a class='link link-primary' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>dial-up</a> Internet connections were booming. I remember how this new world can connect each other, I was really fascinate what i can do.

                        It was inevitable that I started playing with HTML also. I used to make very rudimentary pages about things I liked and hosting them on <a class='link link-primary' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>GeoCities</a> for free.

                        I think making such a big change in my life allowed me to face most of my fears and reassured my self-confidence and trust in my capabilities, which is difficult for someone that is constantly pushing himself to be better.

                        That last experience is what brings me to this moment, returning to my humble beginnings in web development. With all the work experience I gathered on different companies, and the practice gained by studying engineering and a masters, I‚Äôm now focusing all my energy and knowledge into becoming the best web developer I can be, hoping to work in this industry for the rest of my professional life.

                        I know I might be late in the game, but I‚Äôm studying new technologies every day, coding and building projects as often as I can, and looking forward to gaining work experience in web development related companies.

                        I‚Äôm a firm believer in the growth mindset concept, and that ‚Äúlife is not about finding yourself, but about creating yourself‚Äù (George Bernard Shaw).
